During my Ph.D. studies with Dr. Peter G. Wolynes, I specialized in multi-scale computational modeling of biological systems, exploring their molecular-level structures, dynamics, and functions. Most of my work involved employing Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations under a coarse-grained protein force field called the associative memory, water-mediated, structure, and energy model (AWSEM). Additionally, I have experience in building reaction-diffusion models for biological systems and solving differential equations analytically or numerically using COMSOL software. At Dr. Pratyush Tiwary's Lab, I will continue to pursue my interests in computational structural biology, focusing on macromolecules such as proteins and RNA, and leveraging our research for drug discovery.
